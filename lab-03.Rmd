### Load packages

library(ggplot2)
```


# Questioning data visualisations

## Image 1

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/Speaking-the-world.jpg")
```

The first bar is the only one which thickness is different and also the length of the bar is not proportional to the the values that it represents.





## Image 2

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/rose-pop-density-total-area-bw.jpg")
```

The graph is difficult to understand, where is the comparison using both variables, population density and total area? What does the use of the colors mean? It is hard to understand. 




## Image 3

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/life-expectancy-rule-of-law.png")
```

There are no numbers on the axes, and it is difficult to make out the individual countries especially when there are a lot on top of each other, it is hard to read. 


## Image 4

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/global-income-dist.PNG")
```

It is a somewhat complex graph, but readble once understood. However, trying to use this graph for further analysis proves virtually iumpossible, as no reliable observations can be obtained from this graph. 




# Exercises

```{r load-data-staff, message=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
staff <- read_csv("data/instructional-staff.csv")
```


## Exercise 1

What is the difference between *wide format* data and *long format* data?
Wide format is when there are more columns then there are rows. Long format is the opposite, there are more rows than there are columns. 

Is the format `staff` data *wide* or *long*?
It is wide

How many observations are there in the data set?
55



## Exercise 2

```{r pivoting}
<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
## Uncomment and complete the following code

staff_long <- staff %>%
  pivot_longer(
    cols = faculty_type, 
    names_to = "years",
    values_to = "percent"
    )
>>>>>>> 4b3f277c56914386b31fa229e4f9ac5040eb8fe6

(
staff_long <- staff %>%
  pivot_longer(
    cols = starts_with("1") | starts_with("2"), 
    names_to = "year",
    values_to = "percent"
    )
)
```


## Exercise 3

```{r dot-plot}
ggplot(data = staff_long,
       mapping = aes(x = year, 
                     y = percent, 
                     colour = faculty_type)) +
  geom_point()


```

## Exercise 4

```{r bad-line-plot}
ggplot(data = staff_long,
       mapping = aes(x = year, 
                     y = percent, 
                     colour = faculty_type)) +
  geom_line()


```

## Exercise 5

```{r mutate-year}
## Uncomment and complete the following code

#staff_long <- staff_long %>%
#  mutate(year = ______(year))
```


```{r working-line-plot}
# Write your code for Exercise 5 here



```

## Exercise 6

```{r better-line-plot}
# Write your code for Exercise 6 here




```

## Exercise 7

_Write below your ideas for adapting the line plot_

* Idea 1
* Idea 2
* Idea 3
* ...


## Exercise 8

```{r implement-Ex7}
# Write your code for Exercise 8 here
